# Camect-Android-SDK
An Android Implementation of The Camect API

Based on: https://github.com/camect/camect-py

This app does not have the ability to play the video streams well yet. Until
then, install a 3rd-party app that can play RTSP streams, like VLC or TinyCam. This app
will detect it and play the stream in the other app.

VLC for Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc
tinyCam: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexvas.dvr
